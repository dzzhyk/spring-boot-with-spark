# boot-spark

Just an Example Project for:

SpringBoot 2.5.7 + Spark 3.0.3 + Scala 2.12.10

---

There are two modules in this project:

1. web: SpringBoot Web Application.
2. spark: An Spark Project with Scala Language. 


> It's not wise to combine SpringBoot and Spark Application in one module,
> which will cause a dependency confusion and package fault.
